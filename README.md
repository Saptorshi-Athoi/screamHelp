screamHelp
screamHelp is an innovative Emergency Scream Detection application developed using Python, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn. This app employs advanced neural network technologies for accurate scream classification, allowing users to receive immediate assistance in critical situations.

Key features include:

Automated Emergency Response: The app automatically sends out a call for help by transmitting the user's GPS location and emitting a loud noise from the device.
Neural Network Classification: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for training on various sound data, ensuring high accuracy in detecting screams.
Optimized Performance: Implements Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to enhance the performance and reliability of the detection process.
User-Friendly Interface: Built with Kv.ui for a seamless frontend experience, making it accessible and easy to use.
